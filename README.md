# Venture Fiesta - NestJS Backend

Venture Fiesta is a backend application built with **NestJS**, a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications. It integrates **MongoDB** using Mongoose for data management.

## ðŸŽ¯ What This Project Does
Venture Fiesta serves as a robust backend solution for managing data and handling API requests efficiently. It includes a service to **fetch Crunchbase data and store it in MongoDB every 60 seconds**, allowing businesses to access and process structured company information in near real-time. Additionally, it provides authentication, user management, and dynamic API endpoints for interacting with the database. The application is built with scalability and maintainability in mind, making it ideal for modern web applications.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **NestJS Framework** for modular architecture
- **MongoDB with Mongoose** for database management
- **Crunchbase Data Fetching Service** to retrieve and store company data every 60 seconds
- **Axios** for HTTP requests
- **RxJS** for reactive programming
- **Environment Configuration** with `dotenv`
- **TypeScript Support** for better maintainability
